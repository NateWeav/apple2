JASON: I've been thinking a lot about innovation lately
and how does that happen?

00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:14.264 align:middle line:-1
For me, it's having a great team

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:19.937 align:middle line:-2
that is empowered and given the space
to do what they know how to do.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.607 align:middle line:-1
SUZIE: We get to realize ideas.

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:29.696 align:middle line:-2
And Apple people
have some pretty crazy ideas.

DIVYA: Just to be with all these smart people here --
It's hugely inspiring.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:37.371 align:middle line:-2
Plus you know you're working on a product
that's going to reach millions of people.

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:39.456 align:middle line:-1
What can be better than that?

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:43.335 align:middle line:-2
EMILIE: I take a lot of pride in what I do
and so does everyone I work with.

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:47.089 align:middle line:-2
And being around people
who care so deeply about what they do --

00:00:47.256 --> 00:00:49.049 align:middle line:-1
that really is what motivates me.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:55.472 align:middle line:-2
REBECCA: There are very few individuals
that go into the level of detail that we do.

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.309 align:middle line:-1
We drive consistently for perfection.

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.815 align:middle line:-2
EHSAN: But all those technical things, all they do
is they add up to an experience for the customer

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:07.609 align:middle line:-2
that is seamless, that is easy,
that is just natural.

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:10.487 align:middle line:-1
CUSTOMER: Oh, that is so cool! I love it!

00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:12.573 align:middle line:-1
RUCHI: It all looks so smooth and seamless.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:-2
Underneath, every single detail
has thousands of people behind it.

00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:21.290 align:middle line:-2
JASON: We at Apple are looking for people
who are passionate about what they do.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.293 align:middle line:-2
And that passion,
it doesn't necessarily come from experience.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.796 align:middle line:-1
It doesn't necessarily come from education.

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:31.758 align:middle line:-1
It comes from within.
